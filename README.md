# gr-j2497

gr-j2497 contains flow graphs with custom blocks for reading PLC4TRUCKS traffic.

This project is an implementation of a J2497 (PLC4TRUCKS) receiver that can be used with any GNU Radio SDR capable of receiving 100KHz - 400 KHz. For RTL-SDR and others this will require an upconverter.

The custom blocks send UDP packets that are compatible with the `j1708_logger.py` script for https://github.com/TruckHacking/py-hv-networks and the `j1708dump.py` command of https://github.com/TruckHacking/plc4trucksduck. e.g. you can dump PLC traffic with `j1708dump.py --interface=plc` while running the flow graphs in `examples/`


# Prerequisites

```
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
```


# Installation
```
cd gr-j2497
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```


# Usage

Run the flow graphs in */examples* with GNU Radio Companion to view messages in the console panel. If enabled on the decoder blocks, view messages sent over UDP with a network sniffer (e.g. Wireshark) or with `j1708dump.py --interface=plc` command of https://github.com/TruckHacking/plc4trucksduck

* Method 1
  * Phase angle measurement and detecting spikes doesnâ€™t work well in moderate to high noise environments.
  * Correlate with a reference signal
  * Works best at 203kHz
  * Ignore the ASK preamble

* Method 2
  * Corr whole signal to detect burst start and stop
  * Corr 200kHz snippet to decode 0 and 1 in the body PSK
  * Works good in medium levels of noise
  * Ignore the ASK preamble

* Method 3
  * Using Quadrature Demod and measuring the phase-angle of the signal
  * Changes in phase results in phase discontinuities
  * Ignores the ASK preamble
